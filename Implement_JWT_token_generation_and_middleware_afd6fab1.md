# Implement JWT token generation and middleware

Story ID: afd6fab1-b913-4aa0-bdf9-defe2bd6c56b
Intent: Add JWT Authentication System
Run ID: b2443026-565c-46c6-aa8a-c030c98c92a3

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create NEW FILE app/auth/jwt.py with JWT utilities using python-jose library (generate_token, verify_token functions). Create NEW FILE app/auth/middleware.py with FastAPI auth_required dependency decorator for protecting routes. Python-jose and passlib are already installed, DO NOT modify requirements.txt.
